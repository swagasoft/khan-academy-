A function has "constant" growth if its output does not change based on the input, the nnn. 
The easy way to identify constant functions is find those that have no nnn in their expression anywhere, or have n^0n 
0n, start superscript, 0, end superscript. In this case, 111 and 100010001000 are constant.

2 / 4
A function has "linear" growth if its output increases linearly with the size of its input.
 The way to identify linear functions is find those where nnn is never raised to a power (although n^1n 
1n, start superscript, 1, end superscriptis OK) or used as a power. In this case, 3n3n3, 
n and (3/2)n(3/2)nleft parenthesis, 3, slash, 2, right parenthesis, n are linear.

3 / 4
A function has "polynomial" growth if its output increases according to a polynomial expression. 
The way to identify polynomial functions is to find those where n is raised to some constant power. In this case, 2n^32n 
3 2, n, cubed and 3n^23n 2 3, n, squared are polynomial.

A function has "exponential" growth if its output increases according to an exponential expression. The way to identify exponential functions is to find those where a constant is raised to some expression involving nnn. In this case, 2^n2 
n
 2, start superscript, n, end superscript and (3/2)^n(3/2) 
n
 left parenthesis, 3, slash, 2, right parenthesis, start superscript, n, end superscript are exponential.
