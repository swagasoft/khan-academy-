We have several different types of functions here, so we start by thinking about the general properties of those function types and how their rate of growth compares. Here's a reminder of different function types shown here, in order of their growth:
1.Constant functions
2.Logarithmic functions
3.Linear functions
4.Linearithmic functions
5.Polynomial functions
6.Exponential functions


Which type is each of the presented options?
1. Constant functions:
64
2. Logarithmic functions
