There are many different ways to sort. As selection sort runs, the subarray at the beginning of 
the array is sorted, but the subarray at the end is not. Selection sort scans the unsorted subarray
 for the next element to include in the sorted subarray.


 This is the idea behind insertion sort. Loop over positions in the array, starting with index 1.
  Each new position is like the new card handed to you by the dealer, and you need to insert it into 
  the correct place in the sorted subarray to the left of that position.
